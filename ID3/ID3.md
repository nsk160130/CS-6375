This file contains the implementation of ID3 algorithm.


To simplify things, you can assume that the data used to test your implementation will contain only Boolean (0 or 1) attributes and Boolean (0 or 1) class values.
You can assume that there will be no missing data or attributes
You can also assume that the first row of the dataset will contain column names and each non-blank line after that will contain a new data instance.
Within these constraints, your program should be able to read and process any dataset containing any number of attributes.
You can assume that the last column would contain the class labels.
